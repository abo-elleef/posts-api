we need to create a user feed where users can create posts and get the feed of posts created,
the task will be divided into 3 parts BE, and 1 part FE.

1- we need to enable the user to create a post by having an API to create post and api to get all posts.
=> the user should have a name, email and job title, 
=> the post should have text and user.

2- “Plus” users can react or comment on a post by having an API to create comment/reaction and API to get all comments/reactions on a given post.

3- we decided to have different types of posts,
 UserPost,
 Announcements
 Polls, 
 we need to use the same APIs created in step 1 to create and get all the posts.

We need to see your engineering descisions when building the app and how the response will be created.

Also you need to use Grape gem to build the APIs and a bonus if you use GrapeEntity gem.


Frontend part:
Use Angular/React as you conveneint (time) to interface the APIs you created.
